# XVCA
A virtual computer


This computer uses a completely original architecture. As much as possible was made from scratch, including the drive format and character encoding.

See docs/ for documentation (in progress)

## Build Instructions
This project contains three targets:
* XVCA Core
* Assembler
* Drive Manager

To build all three, use `make`
To build only certain targets, use `make xvca` for xvca core, `make asm` for the assembler, and `make drive` for the drive manager.
